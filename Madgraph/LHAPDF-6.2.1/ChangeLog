	than zero-termination, etc.)

2015-12-17  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Add PDF::print() protection against being unable to read the PDF
	set index file, so there isn't a crash for the trivial reason of

2015-09-23  Graeme Watt  <graeme.watt@durham.ac.uk>

	* Determine number of parameter variation members by counting
	number of "+" signs in ErrorType, e.g. "replicas+as+mc+mb+mt".

	* Added a new checkPdfType() member function to PDFSet class.

2015-07-17  Graeme Watt  <graeme.watt@durham.ac.uk>

	* Added support for combined PDF+alphaS sets via new ErrorType
	values, i.e. "replicas+as", "hessian+as" and "symmhessian+as".

2015-04-10  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Updating AUTHORS notice to final EPJC paper reference, and
	adding a final citation reminder message via the Config
	destructor.

2015-03-20  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* src/Factories.cc: Adding a set of expandPDFsStr(), decodePDFStr
	and decodePDFsStr functions to be used for handling more general
	PDF strings of the sort that will be used in the CompositePDF
	factory system.

	* Adding a default constructor and knotarrays() accessor to
	GridPDF, as requested by Nathan Hartland.

2015-01-09  Graeme Watt  <graeme.watt@durham.ac.uk>

	* Remove abs(...) twice in function PDFSet::randomValueFromHessian
	to correct a mistake in Eq. (6.5) of arXiv:1205.4024v2.  The
	correction is necessary to ensure that correlations are preserved

2014-12-23  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* 6.1.5 release.

2014-12-22  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Better error handling in PDF index lookup, including clearer
	reporting of set-unmatched PDF IDs and member numbers which are
	out of range for a valid set.

	* Restoring original active set member in LHAGlue metadata get*
	functions which were previously switching focus as a result of
	calling loadMember() to get numerical grid data.

	* Making LHAGlue Fortran interface switch the current set slot
	more coherently (has_photon is the exception).

	* Attempt to use Threshold* metadata keys for Fortran
	getthresholdm_ and old C++ wrapper getThreshold. Not yet fully
	supported in the rest of the system but we may as well pre-empt it
	while editing LHAGlue.cc.

	* Add missing getdescm_ and getdesc_ Fortran functions.

	* Add missing Fortran getdatapath function, cf. LHAPDF5 but with
	colon separators between multiple paths if appropriate.

	* Add Fortran lhapdf_getpdfsetlist function, returning the list of
	available PDF sets as a space-separated string. Note the lhapdf_
	prefix -- this is the intended 'namespace' form for a new Fortran
	interface at some point.

2014-12-18  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Remove obsolete config flags from lhapdf.conf

	* examples/compatibility.cc: Simplify compatibility macro checking.

2014-10-29  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Add parsing and use of the internal PID data line in GridPDF.cc,
	in preference to the PDF::flavors() method. This fixes a bug,
	since flavors() was sorting the list, meaning that data files
	without monotonically sorted PID columns would wrongly assign PDFs
	to PIDs.

2014-10-08  Graeme Watt  <graeme.watt@durham.ac.uk>

	* Added new ContinuationExtrapolator to provide same extrapolation
	as in the MSTW standalone code (and LHAPDF5 when using MSTW sets).

2014-10-03  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Better code organisation and protection against out-of-bounds
	array accesses in log-bicubic interpolator.

2014-08-28  Graeme Watt  <graeme.watt@durham.ac.uk>

	* Fallback to bilinear interpolator if using bicubic
	interpolator with only 2 or 3 Q2 knots in a subgrid.

2014-08-26  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Improve LHAGlue info messages to not specify that particular
	generators are being used.

2014-08-19  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* LHAPDF 6.1.4 release

2014-08-15  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Adding multiset variants of the 5 getmin/max LHAGlue functions.

	* Adding the 'unofficial' getminmax Fortran function to LHAGlue.cc
	(thanks to Andrey Sapronov for the report and patch).

2014-07-18  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Treat PID 0 as an alias for 21 in PDF::hasFlavor as well as the
	PDF::xf* functions. Thanks to Nathan Hartland for the report.

2014-07-10  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Clarify in lhapdf script help that 'list' by default shows all
	available sets, not those installed on the user's system.

2014-07-09  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Update CONFIGFLAGS docs to fix some errors w.r.t. actual flag usage.

	* Treat a DataVersion of 0 as unvalidated: valid numbers now start at 1.

	* Remove the LHAPDF ID from the warning printout about unvalidated
	PDFs, since in that case there will usually be no standard ID
	number and it just gets unhelpfully reported as -1.

	* Detect and report improperly terminated grid files (ones missing a --- final line).

	* Replace asserts with exceptions and improve subgrid error reporting in GridPDF.

	* Report the value of Q2 that causes a subgrid-finding failure.

	* Improve testgrid to use PDFNAME/MEMNUM arg syntax.

2014-07-7 David Grellscheid <david.grellscheid@ippp.dur.ac.uk>

	* Forbid compilation if the demon combination of Boost < 1.47 and
	GCC >= 4.6, with a serious bug in BOOST_FOREACH, is found:
	http://code-muse.com/2013/08/06/boostforeach-and-compiler-bugs

2014-06-18 Karl Nordstrom <karl.nordstrom@cern.ch>

	* Improved AlphaS ODE solver performance.

2014-06-17  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* 6.1.3 release!

	* tests/Makefile.am: Add appropriate programs to "make installcheck".

2014-06-17  David Grellscheid  <David.Grellscheid@durham.ac.uk>

	* wrappers/python/Makefile.am: 'make distcheck' and out-of-source
        builds should work now.

2014-06-16  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Add CVMFS and AFS downloading (by preference) to the lhapdf
	script, as well as user-configurable download sources and tarball
	removal.

	* Fix bug in PDF::qcdOrder method, and deprecate that method in
	favour of orderQCD (to match AlphaS and the flag name).

	* Further improvements to error messages when trying to load an invalid PDF.

	* Tweak output of testalphas.cc

	* Adding first make check targets (requires CT10nlo to be installed).

2014-06-15  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Flavour thresholds in alpha_s solvers, and threshold subgrids
	from ODE solver (by Karl Nordstrom)

2014-05-10  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Adding initLHAPDF() and a few other do-nothing compatibility functions.

2014-04-25  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* 6.1.0 release!

2014-04-24  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Return -1 for errorConfLevel on replica PDF sets.

	* Mapping uncertainty functions into Python.

2014-04-21  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Derive LHAPDF_VERSION_CODE integer using a Mac-safe sed regex.

2014-04-17  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Fix pdfsets.index parsing (column order) in lhapdf script.

	* Supporting the pkg-config type --cflags and --libs switches on
	lhapdf-config.

2014-04-16  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Adding an LHAPDF5 compatibility mode flag,
	Pythia6LambdaV5Compat, which sets all LambdaQCD common block
	values to 0.192 as was historically the case for PYTHIA6's use of
	LHAPDF. This behaviour is definitely physically incorrect, as well
	as against the spirit of the PYTHIA6 steering flags, but it is the
	long-term behaviour of PYTHIA6+LHAPDF and many PYTHIA6 MC tunes
	have been built around this behaviour. This flag is set 'true' by
	default to minimise user surprise -- if you want LHAPDF to report
	correct (i.e. varying by PDF) values to PYTHIA6, then explicitly
	set this flag to be false in lhapdf.conf or similar.

2014-04-15  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Adding a single-string "dir style" SETNAME/NMEM syntax for
	accessing a PDF set+member.

2014-04-14  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Adding the namespace protection workaround for Boost described
	at http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_55_0/doc/html/foreach.html

	* Adding AlphaS_FlavorScheme and AlphaS_NumFlavors metadata flags
	as optional specific versions for use by the AlphaS system,
	particularly if the alpha_s QCD evolution doesn't match that of
	the PDF itself.

2014-04-13  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Adding a lhapdf.pc file for use by pkg-config

	* Check for sizes of subgrids required by each interpolator
	algorithm (linear ipol requires >= 2 knots, cubic requires >= 4).

	* Renumberings of several MRST and MSTW sets's global IDs:
	    MRST2004qed_proton 20461->20463
	    MRST2004qed_neutron 20462->20465
	    MSTW2008lo90cl 21041->21050
	    MSTW2008nlo90cl 21141->21150
	    MSTW2008nnlo90cl 21241->21250
	    MSTW2008lo90cl_nf3 23041->23050
	    MSTW2008lo90cl_nf4 23141->23150
	    MSTW2008nlo90cl_nf3 23241->23250
	    MSTW2008nlo90cl_nf4 23341->23350
	    MSTW2008nnlo90cl_nf3 23541->23550
	    MSTW2008nnlo90cl_nf4 23641->23650

	* Updates to the CONFIGFLAGS documention, removing some unused
	flags and adding the new Note flag.

	* Printing out a Note metadata entry on set initialization, if one is found.

	* Removing the metadata() functions from Info, since they were
	unused and did not respect the cascading design.

2014-03-25  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* More tweaking of the uncertainty function behaviour.

	* Adding in_range, in_open_range, in_closed_range functions.

2014-03-24  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Removing compatibility auto-cast of PDFUncertainty to
	vector<double>, converting remaining functions to use the struct,
	rationalising the previously split uncertainty() implementation,
	and code tidying.

	* Converting the uncertainty functions to add a no-copy version
	and to return a new struct rather than a vector<double>.

2014-03-23  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Moving new uncertainty functions into a new PDFSet.cc file to keep header clean.

	* Removing now unnecessary cmake check from configure and the docs.

2014-03-19  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Convert lhapdf-yaml-cpp building to use libtool, avoiding
	linking portability issues. Re-enable static library building
	since the necessary symbols now seem to be present (and the
	libtool warning has also disappeared).

2014-03-16  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Disable static library build for now, until we can figure out
	how to portably pull symbols from yaml-cpp into both shared and
	static libs via libtool.

2014-03-15  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Adding more compatibility functions: getDescription, getLam4,5,
	and getOrderPDF functions in old C++ wrapper.

2014-03-15  Graeme Watt  <graeme.watt@durham.ac.uk>

	* Adding new example programs testpdfunc and hessian2replicas,
	functions for PDF uncertainties in PDFSet.h, and backwards
	compatibility functions (+ getnset_, getnmem_) in LHAGlue.cc.

2014-03-13  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	*  Adding implementations of getnf_, setpdfpath_ and placeholder
	getnset_, getnmem_ LHAGLUE functions.

2014-03-07  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Doc updates, and added script and current output to generate a
	PDF sets list Doxygen/HTML input from sets found on the developer
	system.

	* Add a third column to the pdfsets.index file for version
	comparison by the manager script.

2014-03-05  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Protect LHAGlue initialisation from unset Lambda values.

2014-02-12  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	dataversion into Python.

2014-01-29  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Adding the SetIndex and Parent metadata fields, and updating the
	creategrids script, pdfsets.index and tomigrate files accordingly.

	* Removing the external yaml-cpp build option, and
	improving/clarifying the internal yaml-cpp build and linking.

2014-01-27  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Tweaks for better variable-passing to cmake in the bundled
	yaml-cpp build.

2014-01-22  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* configure.ac: Remove opportunistic C++11 build, until this
	becomes mandatory (with removalof Boost). Anyone who wants C++11
	can explicitly set the CXXFLAGS (and DYLDFLAGS for pre-Mavericks
	Macs)

2013-12-20  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Version 6.0.5 release.

	* Internally rename libyaml-cpp.a to liblhapdf-yaml-cpp.a to
	definitely avoid picking up one from the system.

	* Adding comment and empty line support to PDF index parsing, and
	updating pdfsets.index with missing PDFs and assigning LHAPDF IDs
	to ABM12, new MRST QED and MSTW sets, new NNPDF23 QED sets, and
	the first ATLAS PDF sets.

2013-12-19  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Changing the YAML functions to operate in a mangled namespace if
	using the LHAPDF bundled version (a bit of sed and preprocessor:
	not too evil!)

	* Merging in the first version of the lhapdf manager script by David Hall. Thanks!

	* Further tweaking of the grid numerics parsing, using a variation
	on Gavin Salam's FastIStringStream class.

2013-12-17  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Replacing use of the tokenizing istringstream in GridPDF.cc with
	basic ifstream seetg and tellg calls for initialisation speed
	improvement: thanks to David Grellscheid for the suggestion and
	implementation help!

2013-12-14  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Adding a --disable-lhaglue-cxx configure switch and machinery to
	use it (disables building of LHAPDF5 C++ compatibility routines.)

	* Adding requested xfxphoton and getqmass_ functions and various Fortran wrapper fixes.

2013-12-13  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Adding a typedef of auto_ptr as unique_ptr if not in C++0x or later.

	* Adding -DNDEBUG to the CXXFLAGS if not in debug mode.

	* Use C++11 compilation if available.

2013-12-11  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Removing checking for and linking against Boost filesystem and
	system libs!

	* Replacing use of boost::filesystem::path and functions with
	home-made versions.

	* Adding use of a built-in yaml-cpp (0.3.0) if --with-yaml-cpp (or
	similar configure flags) are not specified.

	* Using intermediate static libs to build the source files that
	depend on YAML and Boost path stuff separately from the others.

2013-11-07  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Adding -Qunused-arguments to CPPFLAGS (to keep clang++ quiet).

2013-11-04  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Removing OpenMP directives: the One Definition Rule makes this
	usage dangerous/illegal, and I think we've agreed among developers
	to leave decisions about how to multithread up to the user for
	their specific case.

2013-10-28  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* tests/: adding testing of all available PDF sets' central info systems.

	* Factories.*: mkPDFInfo now returns PDFInfo* rather than Info*.

2013-10-18  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Adding OpenMP directives to all-flavour functions in PDF.h. I
	don't see a big speed difference in profiling, though: -Ofast
	gives a much bigger speed-up.

2013-10-10  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Small improvements to the banner messages when loading a whole PDF set.

2013-10-09  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Version 6.0.4 release.

	* Being a wee bit smart and dropping the verbosity level
	temporarily when loading a whole set, to avoid flooding the
	terminal.

	* Tweaking banner and PDF printouts.

	* Adding verbosity() and setVerbosity() functions.

2013-10-07 James Ferrando <james.ferrando@cern.ch>

	* Fixed handling of Fortran string-in-common-block objects in the initPDFSet routine

	* Added missing initPDFSet variants w.r.t. lhapdf5.

2013-10-07  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Adding banner printout if Verbosity > 0, and extra arg on
	print() methods.

	* More Cython mapping improvements -- PDFs can now return their
	parent set or info objects.

	* Improving error messages when PDF data files are not found.

	* Fixing various aspects of Info, PDFSet, PDFInfo mapping to Python.

	* src/LHAGlue.cc: Removing erroneous if "protection" blocks which
	broke PDF set re-initialisation.


2013-09-30  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

2013-09-22  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Change implementation of forced positivity to use an int value
	to allow for better caching and distinguishing between
	forced-positive and forced-positive-definite. The flag has been
	renamed to ForcePositive, to indicate that it triggers an action
	rather than just being some manually provided information about
	the PDF in question.

2013-09-06  James Ferrando <james.ferrando@cern.ch>

	* Modified PDFLIB comaptibility function to handle format of input arrays from POWHEG.

2013-09-03  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Fixed misnaming in the automatic rewriting of cteq6ll -> cteq6l1.

2013-08-30 Steve Lloyd <slloyd1990@gmail.com>

	* Added functionality for forcing a loaded GridPDF to return positive
	definite values through the flag "PositiveDefinite" in the set metadata.
	This is to prevent overshooting in to negative
	values when interpolating/extrapolating.  Updated creategrids script with a
	--force-pos-def flag to reflect this change.

2013-08-30  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Adding do-nothing overloadings of the 2-arg fallback version of
	get_entry() to PDFSet and PDFInfo: it turns out that inheritance
	and multiple dispatch of class methods don't automatically play as
	nicely as you might think!

2013-08-29  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* 6.0.2 patch release.

	* Updating the version for the latest patch, and being more
	pessimistic about Boost compatibility: assuming that Boost 1.49 is
	the oldest compatible release until we hear otherwise.

	* Reworking the validation system to use 0 rather than 21 for the
	gluon ID (a simplification due to v5/v6 compatibility) and to
	allow building of top PDF validation plots.

	* Removing builds of examples and tests directories from the
	top-level default make target.

2013-08-29  James Ferrando  <james.ferrando@cern.ch>

	* Fix some reference-type arguments in 'Fortran' functions to be const.

	* LHAGlue.h, LHAGlue.cpp: Fortran backwards compatibility routines
	for FEWZ 3.1, and a fix to the C++ backwards compatibility
	routines for getting min and max x and Q2.

2013-08-28  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Removing necessity of Cython for tarball builds.

2013-08-16  Karl Nordstrom

	* Adding log-Q gradient extrapolation in AlphaS_Ipol.

2013-08-16  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* 6.0.1 patch release.

	* Disabling installation of the not-to-be-used 'sets' directory.

2013-08-11  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Fixing an off-by-one error in alpha_s subgrid array creation.

2013-08-08 James Ferrando  <james.ferrando@cern.ch>

	* Added several backwards-compatibility updates for fortran and
	C++ interfaces based on 6.0.0 feedback from David Hall and Marek
	Schoenherr.

2013-08-07  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* 6.0.0 release!

2013-08-06  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Various remaining build system tweaks and updating the version
	code to 6.0.0rc in anticipation of release!

	* Added the lhaglue_get_current_pdf(nset=1) function for C++
	access to the currently-used PDF via LHAGlue (intended as a
	workaround for cases where the old LHAPDF banner was grepped to
	work out the PDF identities).

2013-08-05  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Adding subgridded alpha_s interpolation.

	* Enhancing plotting and comparison scripts for alpha_s comparison.

2013-07-31  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Changing the Q2Min,Max flags to QMin,Max for better readability, etc. PDF and creategrids updated.

2013-07-30  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Adding a migration/cmpplotv5v6 batch script and improving the accuracy measure definition.

2013-07-29  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Changing the data format to list PDF Q knot values rather than Q2, for readability.

	* Fixing creategrids to respect flavour thresholds and subgrids with a --subgrids flag.

2013-07-12  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Version number bump and tag as 6.0.0b3. Nearly ready for stable release!

	* Renaming LambdaX config flags to AlphaS_LambdaX, since their use is alpha_s-specific.

2013-07-10  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Adding --top flag to creategrids, for dumping the 13-flavour NNPDF grids.

	* Adding dumping of alpha_s values to dumpv5v6. Some apparent alpha_s ipol problems for CTEQ6L1.

2013-07-08  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Adding factory methods for making AlphaS objects direct from set names / member numbers.

	* Adding/updating NumFlavors + FlavorScheme metadata flags and add TODOs to respect them.

	* Updated ipol alpha_s solver to operate in log space: smoother behaviour now.

	* Karl made ODE and interpolation alpha_s solvers work nicely.

	* Adding fallback/default-return variants of the Info get_entry and get_entry_as methods.

2013-07-05  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Many improvements to the creategrids migration script.

	* Populating many of the for-migration PDF entries in pdfsets.index.

	* Changing .lha data file extension to .dat to avoid clashing with LHA archive format.

2013-07-04  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Write out AlphaS_Ipol info from creategrids if possible.

	* Use a more accurate MZ in lhapdf.conf and creategrids.

	* Add handling of MinLHAPDFVersion and DataVersion flags if present.

	* Fix LHAPDF_VERSION_CODE to be an int rather than string.

	* Renaming Info::metadata() to Info::get_entry(), plus Info::get_entry_as(), etc.

2013-07-03  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Adding two PDF-level Info factory functions.

	* Using the cached/precomputed log(x) and log(Q2) values in the
	log-bicubic interpolator. Looks like an immediate factor of 5
	speed-up :-D

	* Adding log(x) and log(Q2) knot position accessors to KnotArray1F and KnotArrayNF.

	* Adding log(x) and log(Q2) knot position arrays to KnotArray1F.

	* Converting the KnotArrayNF typedef to be a fully-fledged class.

2013-06-19  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* 6.0.0b2 release.

	* TODO list updated.

	* Adding PDFSet.mkPDF(mem) to the Python wrapper.

	* Various build tweaks for lxplus6 compatibility.

	* Reworking the connection of AlphaS to the Factory and PDF system
	a bit, and tweaking the tests.

2013-06-15  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Adding Config.h, the Config class, and improved singleton
	mechanism for getting the global configuration object. Plus some
	testing of the globalness and persistency of config settings in
	tests/testinfo.cc

2013-06-12  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Mapping addition of PDFSet, more factory functions, and related changes into Python.

2013-06-11  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Adding default values to PDF::xMin/Max and PDF::q2Min/Max.

2013-06-10  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Bump version number for 6.0.0 beta2 (hopefully to be released soon).

	* Adding an availablePDFSets() function.

2013-06-09  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Adding an LHAPDF_VERSION_CODE macro for version detection.

	* Moving contents of Config.h -> Version.h (leaving Config.h name free for potential Info subclass).

	* Adding PDFSet::mkPDF(int).

	* Renaming return-type specialisations of Info::metadata() to
	metadata_to(), to avoid nasty template/untemplated method
	resolution errors once inheritance got involved.

	* Removing various deprecated path constructors and general
	related API rehashing.

	* Adding Info::metadata_local(key)

	* Renaming config() to getConfig() and moving to Factories, to
	match getPDFSet(name).

	* Using a new info cascading system including PDFSet.

	* Adding singleton system for PDFSet, and a dedicated PDFInfo type
	for member info.

2013-06-07  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Rename ImplicitFlavorAction config flag to UndefFlavorAction

	* More build system tweaks, including removal of yaml-cpp flags
	from build of example programs that link against libLHAPDF.

	* Moving broken -I/-L and -D flag settings from configure.ac to
	selected Makefile.am's

	* Adding PDFSet, and migrating examples/testpdfset.cc to use it.

2013-05-17  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Treat a request for PID = 0 as if PID 21 (gluon) had been
	requested. Useful for backward compatibility, but also just for
	convenience since it's much easier to just loop from -6 to 6 than
	to have to skip 0 and add 21 as a special case.

2013-05-12  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Adding x/Q2/Q min/max (virtual) functions to the PDF
	interface. Default implementations use metadata keys only.

	* Adding in-place filling functions for map and vector PDF value
	containers, on the PDF interface.

2013-05-11  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* configure.ac, src/Info.cc: Re-adding yaml-cpp 0.3.x support via
	version detection in the configure script.

2013-05-07  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* src/Info.cc: Converting the YAML reading to use the yaml-cpp v0.5.x API.

	* Tweaking and fixing tests and build config.

2013-04-17  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Adding a PDF set usage example (uses C++11 for now, for fun!)

2013-04-11  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Rename of wrapper dir from cython -> python (reflect the target,
	not the way of achieving it).

	* Python extension build env fix

2013-04-10  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Improving creategrids to use xmin and qmin/max when dumping
	LHpdf files and to allow a manual override for LHgrid
	dumps. CTEQ6L1 looking *almost* publicly acceptable now.

	* examples/: Resurrecting old testpdf.cc as an example (used by Doxygen)

	* migration/: Using compatibility stuff to improve dumpv5v6.cc

	* Adding LHAPDF_MAJOR_VERSION macro and examples/compatibility.cc

	* AUTHORS list tweak since James added substantial code for Fortran compatibility.

	* Adding copyright etc. notices to each file header.

	* Adding LHAPDF.h convenience header.

2013-04-09  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Fix ctypes handling in creategrids

	* Adding ignoring (and writing) of a 3rd grid block line, to
	specify "internal flavor" ID codes. Not actually parsed or
	used... yet.

	* Cleaning up LHAGlue compilation warnings

	* Config flag updates and clarifications, and adding API
	mechanisms for numMembers and LHAPDF ID lookup.

2013-04-08  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Further improved creategrid, comparison, and plotting
	scripts. Better high-xipol knots -> much better agreement. Nearly
	done.

2013-04-08  James Ferrando  <james.ferrando@cern.ch>

	* Fortran PDFLIB function mapping works now: good agreement with
	LHA5 via PYTHIA6.

2013-04-05  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* migration/plotv5v6 improvements with line styles and labels.

	* Improved/fixed migration/creategrid which excludes grid points
	at x=0 (which screwed up handing over to extrapolation) and fixes
	numpy array manipulation. Low-x behaviour is now good, high-x
	needs some inspection: getting close to acceptable at last!

	* Fixes to dumpv5v6.cc flavour ID and output filenames.

2013-04-04  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Re-enabling the -Wno-long-long flag if possible, to avoid build
	warnings stemming from yaml-cpp.

2013-04-03  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* migration/: Many updates to comparison scripts, and adding a
	plotv5v6 script and new README instructions.

	* migration/: Combined dumpv5.cc and dumpv6.cc into a single
	dumpv5v6.cc, with the version selected by a preprocessor macro.

2013-04-02  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Build system fixes... *finally* working on lxplus! :-)

2013-03-25  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Re-wrangling dump, comparison, and migration scripts.

	* Fixing accidental shift of LHAGlue default member from 0 ->
	1. The default index = 1 should only apply to the multiset index
	used by non-multiset functions.

2013-03-24  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Removing uses of Boost range algorithms -- nice, but apparently
	introduces a bit too much sensitivity on Boost version for some
	Mac and SL systems.

	* Adding a NotImplementedError!

	* Adding main PDFLIB functions as implemented in PYTHIA6's pdfdummies.f.

2013-03-23  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Adding non-multiset versions of LHAGlue.cc functions.

	* Use 1 rather than 0 as the lowest (and default) multi-set index
	in LHAGlue.cc.

2013-03-15  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Using much cleverer Boost discovery macros (with a slight fix)
	from https://github.com/tsuna/boost.m4. Need to feed back the
	fix...

	* Adding --with-boost-lib, --with-boost-inc, and
	--with-yaml-cpp-lib, --with-yaml-cpp-inc configure flags,
	particularly for use on systems where Boost's install is a bit
	borked and there is no common prefix dir for which $prefix/lib and
	$prefix/include are valid dirs.

2013-03-05  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Convert LHAGlue.cc to load the 0th member on set initialisation,
	plus some other tweaks (this matches the v5 behaviour _and_ makes
	it much harder to get into an inconsistent state).

2013-03-03  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Remove -ansi from the compiler setup (the long long in some
	yaml-cpp versions is causing trouble, at least on Macs with gcc
	4.2)

2013-03-02  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Adding an example script for using the Python wrapper, and
	improving/fixing the mkPDF mapping.

2013-03-01  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Some LHAGlue fixes and improvements.

	* Fixing environment variable updating for path handling.

	* Adding Cython docstrings and path/version functions.

	* Integrating the Cython extension build into the autotools build/install.

	* Path handling and PDF data file search error reporting fixes/improvements.

	* Add a fallback to use LHAPATH if LHAPDF_DATA_PATH is undefined. (pre-deprecated?)

	* Re-enabling Cython mapping (only the basic functionality subset).

	* Adding LHAPDF::version() function.

	* Adding configure testing for -mt versions of Boost (file)system libs.

2013-02-28  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Adding name+member and LHAPDF ID constructors for Info.

	* Moving config() out of Info.

2013-02-27  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Implemented PDF::setname() and PDF::memberid().

2013-02-26  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Adding a lhapdf-config build assistant script.

	* Adding hacky first implementations of log-space interpolators. Separation of x and Q2 ipol seems ever more likely.

	* Started work on new LaTeX manual/paper, based on previous contribution from Ben and Marek.

	* Cleaning up defunct wrappers directories.

	* Fixing a bug in handling of nearest knot lookup for underflow x/Q2 requests.

2013-02-15  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Adding installation and usage instructions to the Doxy manual.

2013-02-13  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Fixing install path data lookup to include the 'LHAPDF' part.

	* Fixed use of interpolation up to the last knot (in Q2, at least)
	by making KnotArray1F::x/q2below never return the last index.

2013-02-12  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Now installing pdfsets.index into the share dir.

	* Now installing lhapdf.conf into the share dir.

	* Header dependence reduction and include statement clean-up.

	* Reworking Interpolator and GridPDF interfaces to centralise
	index finding. KnotArray1F and NF are now defined as non-inner
	classes in a separate KnotArray.h header.

2013-02-11  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Adding a new implementation of NearestPointExtrapolator.

2013-02-04  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Adding migration/testpdf.cc and corresponding README instructions.

	* Removed debug printout from GridPDF.cc and re-added xKnots() and q2Knots() methods.

	* Updated creategrids script to new format.

	* Creating the migration directory.

2013-01-29  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Updates to TODOs, CONFIGFLAGS, DESIGN, etc. after first dev meeting.

	* More Doxygen: making the namespace and free functions documented, with grouping.

2013-01-28  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Adding backward compatibility special case treatment for the "cteq6ll" misspelling from prehistory.

	* Adding setting of available AlphaS params in the PDF interface.

	* Adding search path set/append/prepend functions, using the LHAPDF_DATA_PATH env variable.

	* More methods, and public access to most data members on AlphaS.

2013-01-25  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Adding sorting of the flavor array when reading from metadata
	(and use of Boost range sort)

	* Fixed clearing of temp double* array variable so subgrid loading
	now works. Interpolation across subgrid boundaries not tested!

	* Added two more ways to assign the grid data arrays, but the
	original way seems fine. Now defining the grid data x/Q2 loop
	order.

	* Fixed the AnalyticPDF example: now simpler _and_ it works :)

	* A bit of virtual function rethinking on PDF.

2013-01-23  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Adding code to allow comments in the grid data blocks.

	* Some DESIGN doc cleanup.

	* Moving tests and their output data files into the tests/ dir.

	* Build system tweaks: adding --with args to configure for Boost and yaml-cpp, and a 'doxy' target.

2013-01-22  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Removing defunct data and knot members from GridPDF.

	* Including general doc files in Doxygen output and finessing Doxygen comments.

	* Adding Doxyfile.in with basic Doxy config.

	* Adding initial CONFIGFLAGS and CODINGSTYLE doc files.

	* AlphaS_ODE reworking -- lots needed.

2013-01-21  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Adding an empty AlphaS_Ipol and making AlphaS_Analytic work with a smooth Lambda4/5 transition.

	* First PDF interpolation test added to testgrid.cc. Looks like it works!

	* Refactoring of the bicubic interpolator.

	* Fixed multi_array reshaping in PDFGrid loading.

	* Removing PDFSet files.

	* Disabling PWD searching due to infinite loop in calls to paths().

2013-01-20  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* More alpha_s calculator evolution, mainly file splitting and adding more data members.

2013-01-19  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Making inter/extrapolator loading lazy (and neater as a consequence!)

	* Renaming PDFGrid -> GridPDF.

2013-01-13  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Using std::auto_ptr to handle Interpolator/Extrapolator
	assignment to PDFGrid, and cleaning up the interface and
	implementation a bit.

	* Using boost::shared_ptr to implement the memory handling in
	LHAGLUE. NB. not std::auto_ptr, or boost::scoped_ptr, and although
	std::unique_ptr would be ideal it requires C++11.

	* Adding alpha_s(Q2) calculation mechanism to the PDF
	interface. AlphaS calculation is not yet properly implemented and
	tested, though, cf. grid interpolation!

	* Adding src/Factories.cc to hide the implementation details /
	dependencies for factory users.

	* Added Info::metadata<bool> template specialisation to handle
	true/false/on/off/yes/no as well as 0/1 strings.

	* Add src/Paths.cc to avoid circular header dependencies.

	* Add LHAPDF_{INSTALL,DATA}_PREFIX variables and PwdInSearchPath
	config flag, and use them in search path determination.

2013-01-11  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Start of the AlphaS refactoring.

	* Metadata methods and flavour list caching added to PDF.

	* Renaming PDFInfo.h/.cc to just Info.h/.cc

	* Renaming LHAPDFConfig.h -> Config.h

	* DESIGN doc updates.

	* Factory renaming and adding factory functions for PDF construction.

	* PDF and PDFInfo extra constructors from LHAPDF ID code.

	* Moving PDFInfo YAML reading into a new PDFInfo.cc to avoid an API header dependency.

	* Refactoring PDF filename construction etc. to minimise code duplication.

	* Adding the PDFIndex.h header and index lookup functions.

	* Adding the start of the LHA Fortran wrapper, based on the Py8
	wrapper by Steve and Martin.

2013-01-10  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* More PDFGrid data loading development: improvements to the API
	and the data parser now works.

	* Adding the error extrapolator to the extrapolator factory function.

2013-01-09  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* A few tweaks to the info/data loader system: PDF loading from
	set name + member ID with cascading info/set/config levels WORKS!

	* Adding more constructors for PDFGrid, calling the new ones on
	PDF to populate the Info class.

	* Adding the EXAMPLEPDF directory for testing.

2013-01-08  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Adding example lhapdf.conf.

	* Inlining, clean-up and other tweaks.

	* Adding PDF base constructors with loading apparatus for info
	from member files + discovery and loading of set-level info.

2013-01-07  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Adding to_str variants for both single objects and for vectors
	of objects which are convertible to string via lexical_cast.

	* Adding the YAML parser operation to the Info class (and its subclasses).

	* Removing Types.h in favour of split Utils.h and Exceptions.h

	* include/LHAPDF/Paths.h: Adding path searching machinery (using Boost.Filesystem).

2013-01-02  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Adding some of the necessary infrastructure for subgrids, and
	rewriting the grid format parser to handle separated subgrid
	blocks. Boost.MultiArray being used for the internal storage in
	place of the dynamically allocated C arrays. Metadata methods are
	currently disabled for porting to the cascading Info system.

2013-01-01  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Major restructuring of the API: lots of subtle problems with the
	first attempt, and room for improvement. Painful, but worth the
	reworking to get it right. Lots left to do... see the TODO and
	DESIGN files for the ideas and tasks.

2012-10-22  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Start of autotools build system on top of initial summer student
	work by Martin and Steve.
