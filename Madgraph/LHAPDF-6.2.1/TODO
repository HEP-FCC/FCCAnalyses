LHAPDF6 TODO list
=================


VERSION 6.2.2
-------------

- **CPU-optimize the grid PDF interpolator code**

   Cache log(x), log(Q) between samplings -> log() still accounts for 15% of
   CPU. Caching grid index lookup, caching interpolation weights, encorage
   vectorization.

- **New Fortran API completeness**

   Extrapolation, interpolation, and alpha_s control, and metadata & uncertainty functions in Fortran.


- **Add an 'lhapdf show' command**

   To print pdfsets.index + cat .info for already installed PDFs.


- **Consider extrapolated cubic splines at subgrid edges (cf. Valerio Bertone et al)**



AS AND WHEN
-----------

- **Handle zipped data files (AB)**

   Prefer zipped single member data files rather than virtual filesystem access
   to the tarball? Can transparently read zipped files with LD_PRELOAD and
   zlibc: is that enough? Or embed a zip-stream and link against zlib?


- **Make it possible to find all metadata keys -- both locally and cascaded (AB)**


- **.LHgrid etc. old-name-tolerance control -- TranslateLHA5Names flag?**


- **Speed up interpolation with GPUs**

   Interpolation of PDFs seems like an potential use case for GPUs, since it's
   normal to query for all partons in the set at once: if we can load the
   relevant ipol anchors for all flavours onto the GPU then we can maybe get a
   substantial speedup. OpenMP did not particuarly help, from quick tests.


- **PDF flavor aliasing mechanism**

   e.g. allow anti-flavours to be identical without duplicating their grids in
   the data files or memory. How could we implement this?


- **Allow use of valence/sea etc. decompositions?**

   GridPDF may be inherited from to allow the returned values to be built from
   separate interpolations of component PDFs such as interpolated valence, sea,
   or difference PDFs that are combined to make the physical ones. The PDG ID
   code range for "generator specific" applications may be used, but we'll need
   to bear in mind that this will mean that the flavor ID list has different
   meanings and contents for internal and external purposes: maybe the
   "internal" PDG ID list needs to become part of the grid data header, or can
   the metadata be used?


- **Using std::function to generically modify the interpolation measures in x, Q (AB)**


- **Separate the x and Q2 inter/extrapolation?**

   Allow mix & match combinations. Would this simplify the code since the
   1D interpolation methods are very simple and the 2D is built from them?


- **Make GridPDFs not read their info or data blocks until an xf value is requested?!**

   Super-laziness! But is there a real gain other than < 1 sec initialization speed?
