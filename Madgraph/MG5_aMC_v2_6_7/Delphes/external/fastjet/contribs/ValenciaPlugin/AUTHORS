The ValenciaPlugin FastJet contrib was written and is maintained and developed by: Ignacio Garcia Garcia, Marcel Vos, IFIC (UVEG/CSIC) Valencia, Spain

The first incarnation of the Valencia algorithm (with two parameters R and beta) was proposed "A robust jet reconstruction algorithm for high-energy lepton colliders", PLB 750 (2015) 95-99, arXiv:1404.4294
The authors acknowledge suggestions by Gavin P. Salam (CERN) and his help in assessing the IR safety of the algorithm

The VLC algorithm (with three parameters R, beta and gamma) is described in "Jet reconstruction at high-energy electron-positron colliders", EPJC 78 (2018) no. 2, 144. The addition of the gamma parameter was suggested by J. Thaler (MIT). The performance of the algorithm is evaluated in detail in this paper, in collaboration with Ph. Roloff, R. Simoniello (CERN) and M. Boronat, J. Fuster (IFIC)
