	* NEWS:
	* VERSION:
	release of version 1.0.0

2014-08-16  Matteo Cacciari <cacciari@lpthe.jusssieu.fr>

        * AUTHORS
        * README
        Some typos fixed and small tweaks

2014-08-11  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@cern.ch> + Gregory (later)

	* SoftKiller.hh|cc:
	replaced index()->tile_index() and is_good() -> tile_is_good() in
	line with name changes in RectangularGrid

2014-08-11  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@cern.ch>

	* SoftKiller.cc:
	added a constructor that takes a RectangularGrid and implemented
	support for the is_good(itile) aspect of RectangularGrid.

	Rather than doing a direct push_back of the PJs that pass the cut,
	introduced an intermediate stage of a vector of indices; gains
	about a factor of two in that part of the code; 

	For both above changes, see
	issue-tracker/2014-08-08-testing-rect-grid/README

2014-08-08  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@cern.ch>

	* SoftKiller.cc: 
	added check for all_tiles_equal_area(), in view of possible future
	cases where they don't (some thought would then be needed).

2014-08-04  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@cern.ch>

	* SoftKiller.hh|cc:
	started experimenting with using a rectangular grid that is being
	developed in FJ3.1. Still preliminary, and controlled through a
	symbol FJC_SOFTKILLER_USEFJGRID that is set in the header

2014-07-16  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@cern.ch>

	* Makefile:
	added dependencies

	* example.cc:
	added output of the pt threshold.

	* SoftKiller.hh|cc:
	added a constructor that allows the user to specify separate
	rapmin, rapmax, as well as different requested rapidity and
	azimuth cell spacing.

	added an apply(...) member, which enables access also to the
	pt_threshold.

	sifter is now by default an uninitialised Selector (and the
	description and code simply ignore it if it's uninitialised).

	grid contents now stored in a C++ vector rather than a C-style
	array. 

	+ various mods to comments

	* example.ref:
	updated this to reflect new output of pt threshold info.

	* NEWS:
	added a draft entry for the 1.0.0 release

2014-07-10  Gregory Soyez  <soyez@fastjet.fr>

	* README:
	added a desctription of the contrib

2014-07-09  Gregory Soyez  <soyez@fastjet.fr>

	* AUTHORS:
	included the arXiv number

2014-05-15  Gregory Soyez  <soyez@fastjet.fr>

	* VERSION:
	set version number to 1.0.0-alpha-PUWS14.1 in preparation for a
	fastjet-contrib release for the pileup-workshop at CERN on May
	2014.

2014-04-29  Gregory Soyez  <soyez@fastjet.fr>

	* Imported the soft killer code from the fast implementation we've
	  used for the results in the paper.
