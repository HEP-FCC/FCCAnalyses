README for the plugins directory/
---------------------------------

This directory contains plugins that allow one to use certain cone
jet-finders within the fastjet framework.

For instructions on how to build and use plugins, see the main fastjet
documentation. For documentation on specific plugins, see the plugin
header files which contain extensive information.

PxCone/
        contains the pxcone code and the associated plugin; note that
        since pxcone is in fortran, when linking with this plugin it
        is necessary to link also with fortran libraries, and the
        variable that provides the options for this F77LIB is defined
        in ../Makefile. 
        ****
        The user should have defined beforehand the environment  
        variable G77LIBDIR which points to the directory containing 
        the libg2c.a library.
        The command 
              locate libg2c.a | head -1 | sed 's/\/[^\/]*$//'  or
              dirname `locate libg2c.a | head -1`
        might help in locating such a directory.
        Alternatively, uncomment the G77LIBDIR line in ../Makefile
        ****

CDFCones/
        contains CDF's code for their jetclu and midpoint jet finders
        (actually in the CDFcode subdirectory), as well as the
        associated plugins.


usage_examples/
        some programs to illustrate use of individual plugins as well
        as several jet finders together. To run these programs, you
        should first:

        - build fastjet (see instructions in parent directory)
        - build the plugins:
            make
          (if you just want a subset of plugins just go to the
          relevant directory and build what you need).

        - then build an example program and then run it
            cd usage_examples
            make
            ./many_algs_example < data/single-event.dat
