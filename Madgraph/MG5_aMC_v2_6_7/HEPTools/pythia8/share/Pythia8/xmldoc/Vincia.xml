<h2>The Antenna Shower Model (VINCIA)</h2> 
 
<h3>Overview</h3> 
 
<p/> 
The cornerstone of VINCIA is a pT-ordered model for QCD + EW/QED 
showers based on the antenna formalism.  Originally developed as a 
standalone plugin, it has been incorporated into the Pythia 8 source 
code since Pythia version 8.300. 
 
<p/> 
<b>QCD:</b> VINCIA's QCD antenna functions incorporate both the 
collinear (DGLAP) and soft (eikonal) limits of QCD matrix elements at 
leading colour. They hence should exhibit improved colour-coherence 
effects relative to Pythia's original (DGLAP-based) simple shower 
model. 
 
<p/> 
<b>QED:</b> 
VINCIA's default QED antenna-shower module is based on a fully coherent 
(multipole) treatment of photon radiation, which is 
interleaved with the QCD evolution. 
Photon splittings to lepton-antilepton and quark-antiquark pairs are 
also included. 
 
<p/> 
<b>EW:</b> Optionally, the coherent QED shower can be replaced by a 
full-fledged electroweak (EW) shower module, which allows for 
branchings involving Z/W/h bosons as well, with antenna functions 
capturing the collinear limits of the relevant matrix elements, 
including ones involving gauge-boson self couplings. This can be used 
to include weak corrections in electroweak Sudakov factors and to 
resum multiple weak-boson emissions (and splittings). Note that, since 
this module is based on collinar approximations, it does not exhibit 
the full coherence of the pure-QED shower module. 
 
<p/> 
<b>Mass Effects:</b> In all cases, the effects of final-state parton 
masses (e.g., bottom and top quark masses) are systematically 
included, and the massive antenna functions have the appropriate 
quasi-collinear limits. 
 
<p/> 
When VINCIA's option for interleaved resonance decays is selected <a 
href="#ResonanceDecays">(see below)</a>, resonance decays are 
interleaved with the rest of the perturbative evolution. This means 
that each resonance in the hard process (or emitted by the EW shower) 
is treated as stable until the evolution reaches a pT scale of order 
the offshellness of that resonance, at which point the resonance is 
replaced by its decay products and an internal ``resonance shower'' is 
performed in the decay system, starting from the invariant mass of the 
decaying resonance and ending at the offshellness scale. The 
decay+shower system is then merged back into the upstream system and 
the evolution of the event continues, starting from the offshellness 
scale. In case of sequential resonance decays, this procedure may be 
carried out either iteratively or sequentially, depending on the 
offshellnesses involved. 
 
<p/> 
<b>Interleaved Evolution and MPI:</b> VINCIA's shower evolution is 
ordered in a measure of transverse momentum and is fully interleaved 
with Pythia's treatment of multiple parton interactions (MPI). When 
the Vincia shower model is selected, both the hard interaction and any 
MPI are showered by Vincia. 
 
<h3>Main Switches</h3> 
 
<modepick name="Vincia:nFlavZeroMass" default="4" min="2" max="6"> 
Controls the number of flavours that will be treated as massless by 
VINCIA, ie with massless kinematics and no mass corrections. The 
remaining flavours will be bookkept with massive kinematics and 
mass-corrected antenna functions.  Note that, even for flavours 
treated as massless, an elementary phase-space check is still made eg 
on all g&rarr;QQ branchings to ensure m(QQ) >= 2mQ.  Likewise, all 
heavy flavours in the initial state are forced to undergo a conversion 
into a gluon when the evolution variable reaches their mass threshold 
(with the threshold determined by the maximum of the PDF threshold and 
the relevant user-specifiable mass parameter given below). 
</modepick> 
 
<flag name="Vincia:helicityShower" default="off"> 
Switch to use helicity-dependent antenna functions (or not). Only 
meaningful when helicity information is present in the Born-level 
events. 
</flag> 
 
<flag name="Vincia:sectorShower" default="on"> 
Switch to (de-)activate the sector shower in VINCIA. In this 
version of VINCIA, the sector shower has become the default, 
due to its better scaling behaviour in multileg matching and merging, 
see below. 
</flag> 
 
<parm name="Vincia:sectorDamp" default="1.0" min="0.0" max="1.0"> 
In the symmetrisation over post-branching gluons that is done to 
derive the sector antenna functions from the global ones, the 
branching invariant with swapped gluons is nominally given by 
<ei>yijSym = yik = 1 - yij - yjk</ei>. If the swapped gluons are j and 
k (and straightforwardly generalised if they are i and j) then the 
collinear <ei>yjk&rarr;0</ei> limit does not change by adding or 
subtracting a term of order yjk. Therefore one could equally well use 
<ei>yijSym = 1 - yij</ei> (or something inbetween). This is still 
guaranteed to be positive definite and was indeed the choice in the 
original sector antenna shower papers. Since the latter definition 
produces a value for <ei>yijSym</ei> which is slightly larger than the 
former, the corresponding 1/yijSym singularities in the antenna 
function are damped slightly, so that larger values of the 
<code>sectorDamp</code> parameter produces sector antenna functions 
which have slightly smaller magnitudes outside the collinear 
limits. Strictly speaking this choice is an ambiguity that should be 
varied for uncertainty estimates, in which context we note that we 
expect it to be almost entirely degenerate with variations of 
nonsingular terms. 
</parm> 
 
<h3>Shower Starting Scales</h3> 
 
<p/> 
Similarly to PYTHIA, for processes that include at least one quark, 
gluon, or photon in the final state, the default choice in VINCIA is 
to start the shower from the factorisation scale used for the hard 
process (as given by PYTHIA for internal processes, or defined by the 
<code>scale</code> value for Les Houches input),while processes that 
do not include any such partons are allowed to populate the full phase 
space. This behaviour can be changed by the following option, which is 
anologous to the <code>SpaceShower:PTmaxMatch</code> option in PYTHIA. 
 
<modepick name="Vincia:pTmaxMatch" default="0" min="0" max="2"> 
<option value="0">Showers off processes that include at least one 
final-state quark, gluon, or photon, are started at the factorisation 
scale, while processes that do not include any such partons are 
started at the phase-space maximum.</option> 
<option value="1">Showers are always started at the factorisation 
scale.</option> 
<option value="2">Showers are always started at the phase-space 
maximum. This option is not recommended for physics runs as it will 
lead to unphysical double counting in many cases.</option> 
</modepick> 
 
<p/> 
When the first branching is limited by the factorisation scale for the 
hard process, a multiplicative factor can be applied to either 
increase or decrease the shower starting scale relative to the 
factorisation scale: 
<parm name="Vincia:pTmaxFudge" default="1.0" min="0.1" max="10.0"></parm> 
<parm name="Vincia:pTmaxFudgeMPI" default="1.0" min="0.1" max="10.0"> 
Same as above but for MPI systems, affecting the underlying event. 
</parm> 
 
<p/> 
Note that for any (combination of) choices that result in ISR showers 
not using the factorisation scale as the starting scale, the generated 
Sudakov factor will effectively produce leftover PDF ratios in the 
exclusive cross sections produced by the shower.

<li>Settings for VINCIA's matrix-element corrections (MECs) 
are described <aidx href="VinciaMECs">here</aidx>. </li> 
</ul> 
 
<h3>Merging with VINCIA</h3> 
 
<p/> 
VINCIA has its own dedicated approach to merging with 
higher-multiplicity tree-level matrix elements, called sector 
merging. Similar in spirit to the CKKW(-L) approaches, it exploits the 
unique bijective property of VINCIA's sector shower to vastly reduce 
the complexity of the merging procedure, so that merging especially at 
high multiplicities becomes more efficient. Settings for VINCIA's 
sector merging are described <aidx href="VinciaMerging">here</aidx>. 
 
<h3>Interleaved Resonance Decays</h3> 
 
<p/> 
Decays of resonances produced in the hard process can be interleaved 
with the shower evolution (see also further comments under the equivalent 
option for Pythia's <aidx href="TimelikeShowers">TimelikeShowers</aidx>). 
In VINCIA, this setting is 
controlled by the following switch: 
<flag name="Vincia:interleaveResDec" default="on"> 
When this flag is set to <code>on</code>, decays of hard-process 
resonances are performed as part of the final-state shower when the 
event evolution reaches the <ei>pT</ei> scale defined by 
<code>VINCIA:resDecScaleChoice</code> below. An internal shower which 
preserves the invariant mass of the resonance is then performed inside 
the resonance-decay system (including nested sequential resonance 
decays) until that system reaches the same overall <ei>pT</ei> scale 
as the rest of the event, at which point the resonance-decay system is 
merged back into the upstream system and the event evolution 
continues.  When this flag is set to <code>off</code>, resonance 
decays are only performed after the shower off the production process 
has been completed. All of the subsequent FSR is carried out inside 
the resonance, with preserved resonance mass. 
</flag> 
 
<p/> 
<a name="ResonanceDecays"></a> When decays of hard-process resonances are 
interleaved with the shower evolution (and for any resonances produced 
by VINCIA's electroweak shower), the evolution scale at which these 
decays are performed (including showers and any nested resonance 
decays at higher scales) is controlled by the following choice: 
<modepick name="Vincia:resDecScaleChoice" default="1" min="0" max="2"> 
<option value="0">Resonance decays are assigned a fixed scale equal to 
the on-shell width of the given resonance. (This option is currently 
not implemented for resonances produced by VINCIA's EW 
shower.)</option> 
<option value="1">Resonance decays are assigned a dynamical scale 
given by <ei>|m<sup>2</sup> - m0<sup>2</sup>|/m0</ei>. This implies, 
e.g., that the decay of a resonance which has <ei>m = m0 &pm; 
&Gamma;</ei> will be performed at a scale <ei>pT ~ sqrt(2) 
&Gamma;</ei>.</option> 
<option value="2">Resonance decays are assigned a dynamical scale 
given by <ei>sqrt(|m<sup>2</sup> - m0<sup>2</sup>|)</ei>. This 
implies, e.g., that the decay of a resonance which has <ei>m = m0 &pm; 
&Gamma;</ei> will be performed at a scale <ei>pT ~ sqrt(2 &Gamma; m0 
)</ei>.</option> 
</modepick> 
 
<h3>Evolution with Enhanced (Biased) Kernels</h3> 
 
<p/> 
VINCIA's shower evolution can be biased to populate the multi-jet 
phase space more efficiently and/or enhance the rate of rare processes 
such as <ei>g&rarr;bb</ei> and <ei>g&rarr;cc</ei> splittings. It is 
also possible to inhibit radiation (e.g., to focus on Sudakov 
regions), by choosing enhancement factors smaller than unity. When 
these options are used, it is important to note that the event weights 
will be modified, reflecting that some types of events (e.g., multijet 
events, or events with gluon splittings to heavy quarks) will be 
"overrepresented" statistically, and others (events with few jets, or 
events with no gluon splittings to heavy quarks) 
underrepresented. Averages and histograms will therefore only be 
correct if computed using the correct weight for each generated 
event. A description and proof of the algorithm can be found in 
<ref>MS16</ref>. Note that care has been taken to ensure that the 
weights remain positive definite; under normal circumstances, VINCIA's 
enhancement algorithm should not result in any negative weights. 
 
<flag name="Vincia:enhanceInHardProcess" default="on"> 
This flag controls whether the enhancement factors are applied to 
shower branchings in the hard-process system. 
</flag> 
 
<flag name="Vincia:enhanceInResonanceDecays" default="on"> 
This flag controls whether the enhancement factors are applied to 
shower branchings inside resonance-decay systems (like Z/W/H decays) 
that are treated as factorised from the hard process. 
</flag> 
 
<flag name="Vincia:enhanceInMPIshowers" default="off"> 
This flag controls whether the enhancement factors are applied to 
shower branchings in MPI systems. 
</flag> 
 
<parm name="Vincia:enhanceFacAll" default="1.0" min="0.01" max="100.0"> 
This enhancement factor is applied as a multiplicative factor common 
to all antenna functions, increasing the likelihood of all shower 
branchings by the same amount. Values greater than unity thus more 
frequently yields "busy" events, with many shower branchings. Values 
smaller than unity suppress additional branchings, yielding more 
Sudakov-like events. 
</parm> 
 
<parm name="Vincia:enhanceFacBottom" default="1.0" min="1.0" max="100.0"> 
This enhances the probability for all branchings that increase the 
number of bottom quarks (i.e., FSR <ei>g&rarr;bb</ei> splittings and 
the corresponding ISR flavour-excitation process). Note: this factor 
is applied on top of <code>Vincia:biasAll</code>. 
</parm> 
 
<parm name="Vincia:enhanceFacCharm" default="1.0" min="1.0" max="100.0"> 
Same as <code>Vincia:enhanceFacBottom</code> but for charm quarks. 
Note: this factor is applied on top of <code>Vincia:biasAll</code>. 
</parm> 
 
<parm name="Vincia:enhanceCutoff" default="10.0" min="0.0" max="1000.0"> 
Do not apply enhancement factors to branchings below this 
scale. Intended to be used to focus on enhancements of hard branchings 
only. 
</parm> 
 
<h3>VINCIA Tunes</h3> 
 
<p/> 
<b>VINCIA has its own</b> set of dedicated tune presets, which can be 
specified by the user. 
 
<modepick name="Vincia:Tune" default="0" min="-1" max="0"> 
<option value="-1">None. No VINCIA-specific tune parameter settings 
will be used during initialisation.</option> 
<option value="0">Hadronisation and MPI parameters optimised for use 
with the VINCIA shower model, used as default VINCIA parameters since 
PYTHIA 8.302.</option> 
</modepick> 
 
<p/> 
<b>Note:</b> the requested tune parameters will only be activated when 
VINCIA is switched on, in order not to interfere with the PYTHIA 
settings when VINCIA is switched off. 
 
<p/> 
<b>Note 2:</b> as with ordinary Pythia tune parameters, the tuned 
parameter values will be superseded by any user modifications made in 
the user's command file or main program.  This should allow sufficient 
flexibility to explore user variations away from the tuned values. 
 
<h4>Advice on Tuning</h4> 
 
<p/> 
Although there are obviously parameters that it makes more sense to 
tune than others, there is no explicit restriction imposed on what 
parameters are allowed to be present in the tune file. This implies 
some responsibility on the part of the user. 
 
<p/> 
<b>As a guideline,</b> the main parameters that need to be properly 
tuned are the non-perturbative hadronisation parameters used in 
PYTHIA's string fragmentation model. Since PYTHIA and VINCIA treat 
soft radiation somewhat differently, there can be important 
differences between the two in the soft region that the hadronisation 
model will not re-absorb automatically and which therefore only a 
retuning can address. 
 
<p/> 
The strategy used for the default tune of VINCIA is to take the 
reference value for alphaS from the current world average value in the 
MSbar scheme, and let the effective shower scheme tuning be done by 
first translating to the CMW scheme and then fine-tune by modifying 
the renormalisation-scale prefactors used for shower branchings. 
 
<p/> 
An alternative (but equivalent) strategy that is often used in PYTHIA 
tunes, is to perceive of the value of the strong coupling itself as a 
tuning parameter.  In this case the interpretation is that extracting 
alphaS from, e.g., event shapes, can be done equally well using a 
shower code as with more analytical approaches. The difference is that 
the alphaS value extracted with the shower code is in an a priori 
unknown scheme, defined by the shower algorithm. If the shower only 
includes LO/LL accuracy for the given observable(s), the extraction 
should be compared with other LO/LL extractions. This typically yields 
alphaS values ~ 0.13 - 0.14. When explicit NLO corrections are 
included for the relevant observable(s), values comparable to other 
NLO extractions should result, around 0.12. 
 
<h3>Expert Settings</h3> 
 
<b>Importante Note:</b> the parameters in this section are intended 
for use only by authors or expert users. 
 
<h4>Octet Partitioning</h4> 
 
<p/> 
Within the antenna formalism, the collinear singularity of two gluons 
j and k is distributed between two neighboring antennae. One contains 
the singularity for j becoming soft, one the singularity for k 
becoming soft. In showers based on so-called global antenna functions 
(as opposed to sector functions), the two antennae share the collinear 
singularity, j||k, point by point in phase space, and only after 
summing over both is the full collinear AP splitting kernel recovered. 
The parameter below controls the repartition ambiguity and gives the 
value of "half" the gluon splitting function on its finite end.  For 
sector showers, this parameter has no effect, as the collinear 
singularities are combined within a single antenna function. 
<parm name="Vincia:octetPartitioning" default="0.0" min="0.0" max="1.0"> 
Gluon-collinear &alpha; parameter. Only used for final-final global 
antennae. Note: only the default value (0) is consistent with the 
initial-final (and initial-initial) antenna functions in VINCIA. 
Special values of interest are: &alpha;=0, which corresponds to the 
Gehrmann-Gehrmann-de Ridder-Glover (GGG) partitioning, and &alpha;=1, 
which corresponds to the Gustafson (ARIADNE) partitioning. For the 
sector shower, the <code>octetPartitioning</code> is forced to 
&alpha;=1, to ensure positivity of the antenna function and as there 
is no sensible meaning of the parameter anymore. 
</parm> 
 
<h4>Verbose Level</h4> 
<modepick name="Vincia:verbose" default="1" min="-1" max="3"> 
Level of detail of information written to standard output on what goes 
on inside <code>VINCIA</code>. 
<option value="-1">No runtime output.</option> 
<option value="0">Quiet. Errors and (important) warnings are 
printed.</option> 
<option value="1">Normal. All warnings and error messages are 
printed, but no additional diagnostic output is given. Standard 
initialisation and summary information is also printed.</option> 
<option value="2">Report. Enhanced runtime output. As for =1, but 
 additional diagnostic information is printed, especially 
when/where errors occur, and additional self-consistency checks may 
be performed. Full initialisation and summary information is 
printed.</option> 
<option value="3">Debug. This level is solely intended to assist 
authors for debugging purposes.</option> 
</modepick> 
 
<h4>Numerical Checks</h4> 
<flag name="Vincia:CheckAntennae" default="on"> 
By default, VINCIA checks antenna functions for positivity and absence 
of dead zones. Switch to control whether to perform antenna 
self-consistency checks or not. 
</flag> 
<modeopen name="Vincia:nPointsCheck" default="1000" min="0" max="1e6"> 
Number of random points to check each antenna functions for 
positivity. 
</modeopen> 
 
<parm name="Vincia:deadZoneAvoidance" default="0.0001" min="0.0" max="1.0"> 
During initialisation, warnings are issued if any antenna functions 
(in dimensionless form, with the Eikonal proportional to 2/y1/y2) 
become smaller than this number, anywhere in the resolved part of 
phase space (away from phase-space boundaries).  This is to warn 
against spurious radiation zeroes or large negative finite terms 
creating "dead zones", or near-dead zones, in the shower. For LL 
showering and matching up to NLO, there is in principle no problem in 
taking this parameter to zero if so desired. However, for the NLL and 
higher-order matching corrections, very small values of this parameter 
may result in weights greater than unity being generated, since the 
corrections are multiplicative and large reweighting factors may be 
needed to "make up" for any near-dead zones at the previous branching 
step. 
</parm> 
 
<h4>Shower Uncertainty Bands</h4> 
 
Automated uncertainty bands are not available in this version of 
the VINCIA code.

<h4>About VINCIA</h4> 
 
<p/> 
<b>The name VINCIA</b> stands for "VIrtual Numerical Collider with 
Interleaved Antennae". This reflects its main properties as a 
numerical model for collider-physics processes based on 
dipole-antennae and interleaved perturbative evolution.  It is also 
intended to allude to a progression from PYTHIA - a name originating 
in ancient Greece - to the renaissance era of Leonardo da Vinci. The 
logo of VINCIA is the "Vitruvian Man", by da Vinci, a choice which 
also reflects the combination of art and accuracy which is necessary 
to write a good event generator. Classical antiquity is still 
indirectly represented, via the namesake of the logo, Vitruvius, a 
first-century (BC) Roman author, architect, and engineer.
