There is no way PYTHIA could contain all processes of interest, 
neither in terms of potential physics topics nor in terms of 
high-multiplicity final states. What exists is a reasonably 
complete setup of all <i>2 &rarr; 1</i> and <i>2 &rarr; 2</i> 
processes within the Standard Model, plus some examples of 
processes beyond that, again for low multiplicities. Combined with 
the PYTHIA parton showers, this should be enough to get a flying 
start in the study of many physics scenarios. 
Other processes could be fed in via the 
<a href="LHA.html" target="page">Les Houches Accord</a> 
or <a href="LHEF.html" target="page">Les Houches Event Files</a>, 
or be implemented as a 
<a href="SemiInternalProcesses.html" target="page">Semi-Internal Process</a>. 
In the latter case the existing processes would act as obvious 
templates. 
 
<p/> 
By default all processes are switched off. You should switch on 
those you want to simulate. This may be done at two (occasionally 
three) levels, either for each individual process or for a group of 
processes. That is, a process is going to be generated either if its 
own flag or its group flag is on. There is no built-in construction 
to switch on a group and then switch off a few of its members. 
 
<p/> 
Each process is assigned an integer code. This code is not used in 
the internal administration of events (so having the same code for 
two completely different processes would not be a problem), but only 
intended to allow a simpler user separation of different processes. 
Also the process name is available, as a string. 
 
<p/> 
To ease navigation, the list of processes has been split into several 
separate pages, by main topic. The classification is hopefully 
intuitive, but by no means unambiguous. For instance, essentially 
all processes involve QCD, so the "QCD processes" are the ones that 
only involve QCD. (And also that is not completely true, once one 
includes all that may happen in multiparton interactions.) On these 
separate pages also appear the settings that are completely local 
to that particular process class, but not the ones that have a 
broader usage.

<h3>QCD Processes</h3> 
 
QCD processes fall in two main categories: soft and hard. 
<br/><a href="QCDSoftProcesses.html" target="page">Soft processses</a> 
contain elastic, <a href="Diffraction.html" target="page">diffractive</a> and 
"minimum-bias" events, together covering the total cross section. 
<br/>Reserved code range: 101 - 110. 
<br/><a href="QCDHardProcesses.html" target="page">Hard processes</a> are the normal 
<i>2 &rarr; 2</i> ones, including charm and bottom production 
(plus an incomplete implementation of <i>2 &rarr; 3</i> processes). 
They are contained as a subset of the soft processes via the 
<a href="MultipartonInteractions.html" target="page">MultiParton Interactions</a> 
(MPI) mechanism. 
<br/>Reserved code range: 111 - 150. 
<br/>The <a href="QCDLowEnergyProcesses.html" target="page">Low-energy processes</a>, 
primarily used for collision energies below 10 GeV, closely mirror 
the soft processes, but without any MPIs to offer an admixture of 
hard processes. Other kinds, such resonant and annihilation processes, 
instead are needed at low energies. 
<br/>Reserved code range: 151 - 160.
