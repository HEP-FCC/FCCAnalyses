.SH DESCRIPTION
.B fccanalysis\-submit
will submit analysis provided in the analysis script to the distributed system
of choice\&. Currently only CERN's HTCondor is supported.
.SS HTCondor
The mechanism of submission of the jobs to the HTCondor depends on the
filesystem which hosts the code of the FCCAnalyses. If the code is hosted on the
AFS the jobs are submitted using shared filesystem mechanism, otherwise spool
mechanism is used.

Here is an overview where the output of the jobs can be saved depending on
where the FCCAnalyses code is hosted:
  | Hosted on \\ Output to | AFS | EOS |
  | --------------------- | --- | --- |
  |                   AFS |  x  |  x  |
  |                   EOS |  0  |  x  |
